# Development

It's recommended you install [hatch] to manage your development environment:

```console
$ pipx install hatch
```

Then configure your development environment:

```console
$ hatch env create
```

You should now be able to bring up the development server:

```console
$ hatch env run serve
======== Running on http://localhost:8080 ========
(Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
